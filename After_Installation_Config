#When the Installation of the Openstack has been completed successfully and with no errors you will notice 
#inside the OpenStack UI into the System Information that the Compute Nodes RBD service is Down. 
#This is happening because of the Ceph service and specific the Ceph OSD disks were the Osd-service is  stoped in all the OSD.
#This error occurs when we set an a filesystem for Ceph ext4 instead of xfs(default).

#From the Ceph Official Documentation :

#We recommend against using ext4 due to limitations in the size of xattrs it can store, 
#and the problems this causes with the way Ceph handles long RADOS object names. 
#Although these issues will generally not surface with Ceph clusters using 
#only short object names (e.g., an RBD workload that does not include long RBD image names),
#other users like RGW make extensive use of long object names and can break.

#Starting with the Jewel release, the ceph-osd daemon will refuse to start 
#if the configured max object name cannot be safely stored on ext4. 
#If the cluster is only being used with short object names (e.g., RBD only), 
#you can continue using ext4 by setting the following configuration option:
